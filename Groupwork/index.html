        <p><big>HTML meaning <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> is a markup laguage that represents the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">frontend</a> of a website. Web
                browsers
                receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
                web
                pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
                appearance.HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
                create
                structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                links,
                quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by <a href="./pages/Elements.html">tags</a>
                written using angle brackets. Tags such as
                img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and /p surround and provide
                information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags
                but
                use them to interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language
                such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines
                the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and
                current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML
                since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the
                canvas element, together with JavaScript.</a></p></big>

        <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
            researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
            "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on
            the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
            relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
            an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
            elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material
            into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the
            browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of
            CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using
            SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These
            formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
            However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with
            attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
            progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

            HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
            November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
            May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)

            HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized
            exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.
            Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various
            proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and
            Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for
            mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.</p>

        <p><a id="HTML 4">
                <h1>HTML 4</h1>
            </a>
            December 18, 1997
            HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
            Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
            Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
            Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
            Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but
            also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of
            style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.
            April 24, 1998
            HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
            December 24, 1999
            HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its
            last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
            May 2000
            ISO/IEC 15445:2000[23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international
            standard. In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical
            Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[23]
            After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel,
            XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.</p>
