    <h1>What is Box Modeling?</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Box Modeling</strong> is a 3D modeling technique that uses simple geometric shapes as the starting point to create objects or models. 
        This approach involves working with basic "boxes" (or other primitive shapes like spheres, cylinders, etc.) that are gradually modified, stretched, 
        divided, or combined to form more complex shapes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Steps of Box Modeling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Basic Shape:</strong> Start with a simple geometric shape (e.g., a box) that represents the general size and proportions of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Detailing:</strong> Gradually add edges, vertices, and polygons to refine the structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Edit and Manipulate:</strong> Adjust the geometry using tools like extrusion, subdivision, or bending.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Final Detailing:</strong> Add fine details to make the final model as realistic or stylized as needed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of Box Modeling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Process:</strong> Starting with simple shapes creates a clear and structured workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Over Proportions:</strong> Itâ€™s easy to manage the size and proportions of the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Working with simple shapes saves time and resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Box Modeling is commonly used for creating characters, objects, and environmental elements in 3D software like 
        <em>Blender</em>, <em>Maya</em>, or <em>3ds Max</em>. This technique is especially effective when you need to 
        progress from simplicity to detailed designs.
