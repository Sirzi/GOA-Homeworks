        <h1>About Lions</h1>
        <p>
            Lions are majestic creatures known as the kings of the jungle. They live in groups called prides, 
            which typically consist of females, their cubs, and a few males. Lions are found in Africa and parts 
            of India. They are powerful predators and play a crucial role in their ecosystems.

            Male lions are famous for their impressive manes, which vary in color and size. They are symbols of strength, courage, and leadership in many cultures around the world.
