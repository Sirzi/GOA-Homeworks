    <h1>Georgian Traditions</h1>
    <p>The culture of Georgia has evolved over the country's long history, providing it with a unique national identity and a strong literary tradition based on the Georgian language and alphabet. This strong sense of national identity has helped to preserve Georgian distinctiveness despite repeated periods of foreign occupation.</p>

    <p>One of the most celebrated aspects of Georgian culture is the "Supra" â€“ a traditional feast led by a "Tamada" or toastmaster, where people gather to share food, wine, and meaningful toasts. These traditions embody the warm hospitality and strong community values of Georgia.</p>
