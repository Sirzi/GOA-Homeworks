        <h1>Lions: Kings of the Jungle</h1>
        <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are among the most iconic and well-known animals in the world. They are found mainly in
            Africa and parts of Asia, although their populations are now limited and scattered.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h2>Lions' Natural Habitat</h2>
        <p>Lions primarily inhabit African savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. There is also a small population of
            Asiatic lions in India, specifically in the Gir Forest National Park.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Social Structure of Lions</h3>
        <p>Lions are unique among cats as they live in groups called prides. These prides typically consist of related
            females, their offspring, and a few males.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Royal Leadership</h4>
        <p>In a pride, the dominant males often serve as protectors and leaders, although the females are responsible
            for the majority of hunting and providing food for the group.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h5>Threats to Lion Populations</h5>
        <p>Today, lions face numerous threats, including habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Their
            numbers are in decline, and conservation efforts are crucial to their survival.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>Lions are truly the kings of the animal kingdom, but it is vital to protect their habitats and ensure their
            future for generations to come.</p>
